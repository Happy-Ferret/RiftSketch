RiftSketch is a web-based live coding environment for Virtual Reality.

It lets you code a "sketch" in JavaScript, using
[ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/), while the world around you changes immediately
as you code.

It's quite a niche application since you need to have a VR HMD, be a
JavaScript programmer *and* be sufficiently familiar with Three.js but if you
meet that criteria it's surprisingly fun and engaging!

## Features
- Live-coding with real-time scene updates
- Collaborative coding. Share your creations.
- Convenient keyboard shortcuts
- Leap motion support
- Webcam pass-through

## Setup
If you happen to have an Oculus Rift and you want to try it out yourself, download a
developer build of Firefox or Chrome that includes the WebVR APIs from
[MozVR](http://mozvr.com/downloads) or
[the Chrome dev build share](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzudLt22BqGRbW9WTHMtOWMzNjQ&usp=sharing#list)
and visit http://brian.peiris.io/RiftSketch/ with your Rift hooked up.
