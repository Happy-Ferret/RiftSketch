RiftSketch is an HTML5 live-coding environment for the Oculus Rift.

It lets you code a "sketch" in JavaScript, using ThreeJS, and the world around you changes immediately as you code.

It's quite a niche application since you need to have an Oculus Rift, be a JavaScript programmer *and* be sufficiently familiar with Three.js but if you meet that criteria it's a surprisingly fun and engaging experience!

## Setup

If you happen to have a Rift and want to try it out yourself, download a developer bulid of Firefox or Chrome that includes the WebVR APIs from http://mozvr.com/downloads.html or https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzudLt22BqGRbW9WTHMtOWMzNjQ&usp=sharing#list and visit http://brian.peiris.io/RiftSketch/ with your Rift plugged in.
